# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Terrorism

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI report that analyzes terrorism data across various dimensions. The report is divided into five pages, each providing unique insights into different aspects of terrorist attacks.

### Pages in the Report

1. **Geographical Analysis of Attacks:**
   - Analyzes the distribution and frequency of terrorist attacks across different countries and cities.
   - Visualizations include maps, pie and bar charts to highlight hotspots of terrorism.

2. **Temporal Analysis of Attacks:**
   - Examines the trends and patterns of terrorist attacks over time.
   - Visualizations include line charts, bar charts, and matrix tables to show annual, monthly, and daily trends.

3. **Attack and Target Type Analysis:**
   - Focuses on the types of attacks and the targets most frequently attacked.
   - Visualizations include bar charts, line charts, donut charts and matrix tables to show the distribution of attack types and target types.

4. **Impact Analysis:**
   - Assesses the impact of terrorist attacks in terms of casualties and property damage.
   - Visualizations include bar charts, column charts, pie charts, and and line charts to show the extent of damage and casualties.

5. **Weapons and Perpetrators Analysis:**
   - Analyzes the types of weapons used in attacks and the groups responsible.
   - Visualizations include donut charts, bar charts and tree maps to show weapon distributions and group involvement.

### Preprocessing Steps

Basic data preprocessing was performed using Power BI, including:
- Changing data types
- Promoting headers
- Adding conditional columns
- Removing and duplicating columns
- Merging columns
- Adding new visualizations from the Power BI marketplace
